## 封面图提示词

A split-screen photograph showing a modern office building on the left side, and on the right side, the same building rendered as a digital, translucent hologram floating in a futuristic data space. The left side is realistic photography with natural lighting, the right side has a subtle digital grid overlay and soft blue data stream effects. The composition is balanced and clean, with the building as the clear focal point on both sides. The overall image looks like a professional corporate photography with a creative digital art twist. The scene is shot in 16:9 wide format, ultra-detailed, 8K quality, natural proportions, balanced composition.
